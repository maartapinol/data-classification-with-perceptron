# data-classification-with-perceptron

Perceptron is a supervised algorithm for binary classification i.e. elements are classified in two classes. Supervised means that in this type of classification we initially have knowledge about the category or class to which each of the elements of the training data set belong. 
Perceptron uses the following linear prediction function as a classifier of the input vectors in two classes or labels:
